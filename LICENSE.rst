Additional software for use with xtas
-------------------------------------

xtas acts as a package manager and shell for several tools and data sets. It
will download and run these programs and data sets for you when you use the
corresponding xtas functions. For your information, as of writing, these were
distributed under the following licenses:

- Heideltime: GNU General Public License version 3 or higher
- ILK Frog: GNU General Public License version 3 or higher
- RUG Alpino: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or higher
- SEMAFOR: GNU General Public License version 3 or higher
- Stanford CoreNLP 3.4.1: GNU General Public License version 3 or higher
- Stanford NER: GNU General Public License version 2 or higher

Heideltime requires Treetagger, which as of writing is licensed under a
restrictive license which only allows research and teaching use. xtas will
not download or install Treetagger. If you meet the license requirements,
you can install Treetagger yourself, and point xtas at it; xtas will then
install Heideltime for you and configure it to use your Treetagger
installation.

External data sets for use with xtas
------------------------------------

xtas will download and use several data sets as required to implement some
of its functionality. These are

- `polarity dataset v2.0
  <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/>`_ (no explicit
  license)
- `emotion classification dataset of Buitinck et al.
  <https://github.com/NLeSC/spudisc-emotion-classification>`_ (You may use
  this data for academic/research purposes.)
- `University of Antwerp CoNLL'02 data
  <http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2002/ner/>`_ (Files in these directories
  may only be used for research applications in the context of the
  CoNLL-2002 shared task. No permission is given for usage other applications
  especially not for commercial applications.)

xtas will require you to explicitly acknowledge these restrictions when using
the corresponding functionality.

External services for use with xtas

`request citation of their publication(s) <http://semanticize.uva.nl/doc/>`_
if you use this webservice for your own research.

Python dependencies
-------------------

xtas uses (links to) a number of Python libraries. These are not distributed
with xtas, but installed by pip when you install xtas. As of writing, these
dependencies are distributed under the MIT, New BSD, and Apache License v2.0
permissive open source licenses, and in some cases under the GNU Lesser
General Public License v2.1. See requirements.txt and requirements3.txt for
