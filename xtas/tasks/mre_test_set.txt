The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary clich√©s.The film is not too scary that it becomes unwatchable, so the full potential of its enormity will not be missed. definitely two thumbs uo for me. Fear_Love_Surprise
Finally a horror/thriller movie that has a plot and scary bits! Fear_Love
Most go for the scare and have no plot, so when they aren't scary they suck! None
It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. Fear_Love_Sadness
Think again and watch "Saw", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.'"Saw" has been advertised as the new "Se7en" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, "Saw" does a much better job at actually being creepy. Fear_Love_Surprise
Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. Fear_Love
If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. None
Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul. Fear_Love_Sadness
